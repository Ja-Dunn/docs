## Visual Studio

If you're using Visual Studio to develop .NET Core apps, the following table describes the minimum required version of Visual Studio based on the target .NET Core runtime.

| .NET Core SDK version | Visual Studio version                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 3.0                   | Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3 or higher. |
| 2.2                   | Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9 or higher. |
| 2.1                   | Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or higher. |

If you already have Visual Studio installed, you can check your version with the following steps.

01. Open Visual Studio.
01. Select the **Help** menu > **About Microsoft Visual Studio**.
01. Read the version number from the **About** dialog.

### Download

Visual Studio installs the latest .NET Core SDK and runtime, so you can target your app to run on the .NET Core runtime version of your choice.

- [Download Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2019).

Selecting any of the managed workloads for **Web**, **Desktop**, or **Azure development**, will install the .NET Core SDK development tools and runtime. Specifically choosing the **.NET Core** workload also installs .NET Core.

## Install with PowerShell automation

The [dotnet-install scripts](../tools/dotnet-install-script.md) are used for a non-admin install of the CLI toolchain and the shared runtime. You can download the script from [dotnet-install script reference page](../tools/dotnet-install-script.md).

The script defaults to installing the latest "LTS" version, which is currently .NET Core 2.1. To install the current release of .NET Core (3.0), run the script with the following switch:

```powershell
dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel 3.0
```

The installer PowerShell script is used in automation scenarios and non-admin installations.
