# Install the .NET Core Runtime

In this article you'll learn how to download and install the .NET Core runtime. The .NET Core runtime is used to run apps created with .NET Core.

You can download and install .NET Core directly with one of the following links:

- [.NET Core 3.0 downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).
- [.NET Core 2.2 downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).
- [.NET Core 2.1 downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).

You can also install .NET Core as part of an integrated development environment (IDE) detailed in the sections below.

## Install with an installer

Both Windows and macOS have standalone installers which can be used to install the .NET Core runtime.

- Windows [x64 CPUs](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-3.0.0-windows-x64-installer) | [x32 CPUs](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-3.0.0-windows-x86-installer)
- macOS [x64 CPUs](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-3.0.0-macos-x64-installer)
